# Keras-Yolov3-Video-and-Object-detection
YoloV3 pretrained Video and Object detection in Keras

Observation: Yolov3 is faster(more FPS) then FasterRCNN/ResNet50 combo., however,

FasterRCNN detected more objects than YoloV3 on the same image and same confidence threshold levels.

On the enclosed image FasterRCNN detected 94 objects at 25% confidence, where as YoloV3 detected

69 objects at 20% confidence.


Both have some false/incorrect detection/labeling problem
